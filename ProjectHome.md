# Project FlightSchool #

[FlightSchool](http://code.google.com/p/flightschool/) is an open-source web application aimed at flight schools and air clubs, providing a complete online scheduling, accounting system, content-management and online community solution. The application was originially developed as a project for [Software Engineering for Internet Applications](http://philip.greenspun.com/teaching/6171/2006-spring) class at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu), taught by [Philip Greenspun](http://philip.greenspun.com/), and is currently being used by [East Coast Aero Club](http://ecacbed.com). The full overview of the system is available [here](http://flightschool.googlecode.com/files/FlightSchool.pdf).

**As of 2008, FlightSchool software is no longer supported. If you would like to try it out on your own you can check out the [Manual Setup Instructions](http://code.google.com/p/flightschool/wiki/DebianInstall).**
