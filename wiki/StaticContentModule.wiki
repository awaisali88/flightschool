= Static Content Module =

== Purpose ==
This module provides following functionality:
 * Storing static pages (About, FAQ, Contact Us, etc) 
 * Online interface for editing static pages and hierarchically organizing them
 * Standardized URL to static page mapping 

== Design ==
Like most other text content in the system, the static pages are stored in the [wiki:DBSchema#documentstable documents] table.
 * The document_type column value for static pages is 'static_page'. 
 * refers_to column is used to point to the parent of a page, establishing hierarchy
 * there exists a root static page (created at DB init) 
   * root page is defined as a row in documents table with document_type = 'static_page' and refers_to = NULL
 * one_line_summary column is used to store static page title
 * url_name column is used for mapping from URLs to static pages
   * URL for a page are the aggregated url_names of the pages on the path from root page to the specific page, separated by '/'

URL to static page mapping:
 * routes.rb file is altered to refer all URLs of the form /content/* to the static page controller
 * URL for a page is always of the form /content/path/to/document where pieces of URL after /content/ are the url_name column values of the pages on the path from root page to the specific page
 
== Sources ==
 * trunk/app/controllers/static_controller.rb
