= User Registration Module =

== Purpose ==
User registration module is responsible for basic user management functionality, including:
 * User signup and email verification
 * User authenication
 * Lost password recovery 
 * Permission checking 
 * User administration 
  * creation of accounts by admin
  * approving and suspending accounts
 
== Design ==
User Registration Module is based on the [http://api.rails-engines.org/login_engine/ Rails Salted Hash Login Engine]

Model:
 * All user accounts are stored in a single users table in the database. 
 * User's email is their Login ID
 * User's password is stored in the database in SHA digested form

Permission Checking:
 * Permission checking code resides in a PermissionsChecker Ruby module in /lib. 
 * All controllers requiring permissions register a before_filter hook that links to load_permissions method in PermissionsChecker, which refreshes user's permissions.
 * Controllers can use permission level methods defined in PermissionsChecker to verify certail level of authorization
   * Example: {{{admin? , can_edit_any_user_info?}}}
